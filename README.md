A summary of what I did:

1. **Loaded Data from CSV**: I loaded data from a CSV file named 'Visa.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv` function in Python.

2. **Converted Object Columns to Dates**: I identified that some columns in the DataFrame were stored as objects, likely containing date information. To convert these columns to proper date data types, I applied the `pd.to_datetime` function.

3. **Filtered Non-Date and Non-Numeric Values**: I created a custom function to filter and replace non-numeric and non-date values with blank ('') in the DataFrame using the `applymap` method.

4. **Dropped Unnamed Columns**: To clean up the DataFrame, I removed unnecessary unnamed columns from it using the `drop` method.

5. **Visualized Data**: I used Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations like scatter plots to explore and possibly find correlations in the data.

6. **Excel Integration**: I inquired about integrating Python code into an Excel workbook using VBA and running Python scripts from Excel.

7. **Creating Hyperlinks**: I also learned how to create hyperlinks in an HTML document using the `<a>` element and how to format them to display on separate lines.

8. **Making Workbook Read-Only**: Finally, I explored how to make an entire Excel workbook read-only by marking it as "Final" to prevent users from making changes.

These steps indicate a data analysis and visualization process in Python, as well as some HTML and Excel-related tasks. It's a comprehensive workflow covering data manipulation, visualization, and integration into different platforms.# Python-Project
